	<h1 id="first">About Us</h1>
<h2 id="first">Our Organisation</h2>
<p> As you may have seen in our homepage, our organisation is a non profit organisation in laymen's terms this means what we do doesn't get us paid at all</p>
<p>This organisation's primary focus is on the people who are unable to finish their schooling because of money or are unemployed.</p>
<p> We have multiple teams all across Africa and they make sure they help out in certain locations which they have been assigned to help out on</p>
<h4>Since our organisation is just starting out we don't have much we can say but we will add much more as time goes on</h4>
<br>

<h2 id="third">Our History</h2>
<p> Our organisation may have just started to stand out now but if we dig down the history line, We will find out that the founder of our organisation "Mr Arehone Accurate Mulovhedzi" used to do charity when he was at an early age as the age of 15.</p>
<p>He sat down with us one day and he began to tell us when he was the age of 15 he was coming from school and since it was exam times he didn't use anyform of transportation so he had to walk around 8 km.And he said that one of those exam days he met an old woman who was caring a sack full of cans. And he had money in his pocket and his heart kept on telling him to give her the money he has but he ignored her because he was ashamed of what his friends would say to him.</p>
<p> So after passing her he didn't regret anything but when he reached home that night a sharp pain hitted his heart with regret when he was praying and then he begin to feel like he just missed an angel because that woman seemed to him like she was ordinary.He said from that day he begin to help people in need especially when he meets them along the way and 95% of them didn't know him and also he didn't know them</p>
<p> Even with all that giving he still had that regret from that day and he kept praying to God to bring that old woman again.But that seems not to be happening for months and months with that pain</p>
<p> Until a year later when he saw that woman again during the morning when he was waiting for the school transport and that woman was picking up some trash. Then he just froze until she was going the he shouted <h4>"Grandma!"</h4> Then she stopped and turned around. He reached his pocket a gave her all the school pocket money he was given for that day. And he said from that day he felt like God just opened a door which will determine all his life. And indeed now we are here today as an organisation because of that day. So our organisation started long ago with a young boy with a vision.</p>

<p>Our Mission is simple as ABCD because all we want to give a chance to the people who had their chances taken away not because they were lazy but because they were hindered by thier leaders who are corrupt.Our Mission is to give hope to the hopeless and to give them a chance to prove themselves.It may take a long time to do that but surely at the end of the day we will do what is supposed to be done and we will die for it if we have to. We have given our lives into completing these tasks.In this manner we believe very soon Africa's unemployment rate is going to decrease drastically because of the army we are building now. The army that doesn't fight with swords or weapons but the army which fights with knowledge. THATS OUR MISSION.</p>

<!-- THIS WORK IS FRUSTRATING MAM -->
<p>We have a goal called VISION 2025, this goal is aiming that at the end of the year 2025 we should have reached at least 15 countries worldwide.</p>
<p>And by that time we should have raised about 52 000 people who were nothing into people with a living. We have already started with some right now but we will not release the full numbers until VISION 2025. As far as we are seeing what is going on around the world we can say that we are in complete sure that 52 000 is the minimum number.</p>
<p> In the course of these 5 years we are aiming into building schools for children but it won't be a normal school because there we will focus in developing their skills rather than theory. Thats what we will start doing in the course of 7 months from the day we start with our projects.We want to make Africa great once again like in the days of our ancenstors..</p>
<h4>NOTE:More will be added as we first finish with the projects at hand</h4>
